# Introduction

The Threat Intelligence Platform is an app made by [SEKOIA.IO](http://sekoia.io/) to help you build and disseminate your own Cyber Threat Intelligence.

It is meant to store all levels of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), from strategic (targets, motivations) to technical (indicator of compromises). It also provides you with Content Creation tools as well as Investigation means to help you stay up-to-date when it comes to analyzing Cyber threats.

#### Produce Content <a href="#produce-content" id="produce-content"></a>

To be able to produce your own Intelligence and start complex investigations on topics of interest to you, we have developed a mechanism to allow your analysts to suggest content, review others’ content and merge it to the database once it’s approved by the team.

* Create complex [Content Proposals](.gitbook/assets/content\_proposals) to enrich the CTI database.

#### Customize <a href="#customize" id="customize"></a>

Adapt and customize your intelligence flows based on your needs. To get more information about a specific sector, activity, source or geographical area, you can use our filters to have access to content 100% tailored to your needs.

* Filter the content you see in the database by setting up [feeds](.gitbook/assets/feeds).

#### Automate <a href="#automate" id="automate"></a>

To automate recurrent processes and tasks (enrichment, contextualization, investigation…), you can rely on tools we developed to optimize your time and do an efficient work using our TIP platform.

* Configure [Playbooks](.gitbook/assets/automate) to automate repetitive tasks and enrich the CTI database.
* Avoid false positives and provide more context with Warning Rules.
* Define an indicator’s validity by setting up Expiration Rules.

#### Report <a href="#report" id="report"></a>

The spread of security products within a system can make it hard to follow the actual state of your security stance. With SEKOIA.IO, you can use the dashboard module and its widgets to customize your reportings in order to visualize your own KPIs.

* Create and edit your dashboards to monitor sectors, content being produced or your threat database evolution.
